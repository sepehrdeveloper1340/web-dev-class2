            You love (groan) dad jokes and you actually love mom jokes, but kids are natural comedians! Why not encourage them to get punny with these kid-approved quips that require little to no explanation from parents? Whether it’s a joke a day for the kids, lunchbox jokes for every day or clean jokes to tell to kids, don’t be surprised when the comedy sketch goes beyond today! Scroll down for corny jokes and silly jokes, many of which have been sent to us by kid-readers (like you!).
